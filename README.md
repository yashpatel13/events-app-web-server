# Sample Web Server - Step 1
## Technology
* NodeJS version 16.14.2 or greater as the Server
* NPM version 7 or greater
* Express for RESTful Routes
* Morgan for Logging
* Mocha, Chai, NYC for Testing

## Instructions
* Check the version of node with ` node -v`  
  if it is less than 16.14.2 use nvm to install version 16.14.2  
  You can check if you have nvm installed with `nvm -v`  if this returns the version of nvm  
  you can then use  `nvm install 16`  and `nvm alias default 16`
  If you don't have nvm installed I suggest that you install it because it is by far the easiest way to switch between version of NodeJS.
* Check the verion of npm that is installed with `npm -v` it should be greater than version 7
* Run ` npm install ` to load the dependencies.
* Now `npm start` will start the server on `port 8082`

## Starting Point  
Simple Web server interacting with simple API server that uses volatile storage. Data will be stored in an array on the API server.
